# MDDN 242 2023 Project 2: HEXATYPE

## README

### The Idea
The idea was to keep the theme of geometry in my project. In the alarm project, I used a 10 sided polygon to create the face of a clock. For this project, I wanted to have a similar idea. Originally I wanted to see how I could manipulate multiple types of regular polygons together to create letters and shapes. While I was procrastinating playing a video game (Dead By Daylight), I got inspired to create letters out of matches and a hexagon. In Dead by Daylight, there is a feature called Bloodweb. In the middle, it starts in the middle, but then stick-like lines would stretch towards a hexaganol item. My idea was similar. To have a hexagon be the main base piece. and have the form of the alphabets and numbers be built around the shape.

### Design Choices
In total, I have got 19 parameters. 3 for the hexagon (size, positionX, positionY), and 2 for each of the eight vertexes for the lines to connect (positionX, positionY). The idea was that I would first position the hexagon in place, then one by one, I would place the line vertexes around the hexagon and into letter forms. As I created more and more forms, the design felt more futuristic and cyberpunkish. Because of that, I experimented with how make the hexagon colourful. Static colour looked cool, but I wanted to turn it into a futuristic, cyberpunk, neon light. To top it off, I added a glow which made the feel of the forms pop out and impactful.

### Precedents
You should look into the game Dead By Daylight (but don't play it). My colourful keyboard that has lights in and it goes throught different colours.

### Reflection
The design of my letterforms were simple yet when put together is effective. I wanted my forms to be readable and consistent, always making sure that the form is built around a hexagon. Im satisfied with the end result as each letter does feel connected with eachother. I had to recreate some letters because the froms felt inconsistant - too blocky, to much emphasis on the hexagon. I do wish that I could have designed the forms so when it transitions from one to another, it would fold into itself before revealing it's new form. However this would have taken a lot of lines and steps. It would have been too difficult. What wasn't difficult was setting up the parameters.  It took some time to think about what I wanted my design to look like, but once I started, it became easier to come up with parameters. Once I had my parameters made, it was easy to create the form.

### Random Tangent
Seriously, don't play Dead by Daylight. That game will consume you.
